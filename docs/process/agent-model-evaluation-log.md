# Agent Model Evaluation Log

Purpose: record per-task executor/validator efficiency evidence so the next VIDA
task can choose a cheaper or stronger model deliberately.

## 2026-06-11 - lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority

Scope:
- Task: `lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority`
- Files: `crates/vida/src/lane_surface.rs`, `crates/vida/tests/task_smoke.rs`
- Proof:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo test -p vida --test task_smoke external_attempt_scope_guard -- --exact --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p vida lane_surface::tests::lane_complete_host_bridge_rejects_unverified_request_artifacts -- --exact --nocapture`

Observed model results:
- Executor `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. It produced the
  correct success-path direction and useful regression assertions, but timed out
  without a final report and missed blocked-result blocker preservation.
- Validator `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning: 0/10 for this slice because it
  timed out and returned no actionable validation evidence.
- Orchestrator scoped fix: one narrow local correction under active exception
  takeover restored the blocked-result summary/delegated-cycle blocker.

Next-task selection rule:
- Use `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` only for one-file execution packets with one
  focused proof command and an explicit stop point.
- Do not use long-running `gpt-5.5 medium` validation prompts until the host
  agent timeout/runtime blocker is fixed; prefer shorter read-only prompts split
  by concrete risk.
- Require final reports to include proof commands, pass/fail counts, token usage
  if exposed, and tool-call count or an explicit "not exposed" statement.

## 2026-06-11 - wave0-consume-resume-missing-task-guard-order
- Task: `wave0-consume-resume-missing-task-guard-order`
- File: `crates/vida/src/taskflow_consume_resume.rs`
- Proof:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo test -p vida validate_run_graph_resume_state -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p vida resolve_runtime_consumption_resume_inputs -- --nocapture`
Observed model results:
- Executor `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 0/10 for execution in this
  slice because the worker timed out without a completion receipt or patch
  closure.
- Validator `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning: 8/10. It caught three real
  false-green risks: unsuperseded exception takeover authority, retry-eligible
  missing-task bypass, and candidate downstream packet evidence without result
  lineage. It did not run tests.
- Validator `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. It caught the remaining
  default no-`--run-id` explicit-binding redirect gap and supplied focused test
  evidence, but it missed the broader predicate risks caught by 5.5.
- Orchestrator scoped fix: accepted both validators, narrowed authority
  predicates, kept stale missing-task fail-closed behavior, and passed focused
  proof.
Next-task selection rule:
- Use `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` as a cheap focused validator for one failing
  test or one resolver path, not as the only broad reviewer.
- Use `gpt-5.5 medium` validator for predicate/authority reviews where
  false-green risk matters.

## 2026-06-11 - wave-0-runtime-authority-rt001-rt004

Scope:
- Parent: `wave-0-runtime-tests`
- Closed tasks:
  - `wave-0-red-tests-rt001`
  - `wave-0-red-tests-rt002`
  - `wave-0-red-tests-rt003`
  - `wave-0-red-tests-rt004`
- Proof families:
  - focused public CLI smoke tests for the changed operator surface,
  - focused unit/module tests for the shared authority helper,
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  - `cargo build`,
  - `git diff --check`.

Observed model results:
- `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning is useful as a cheap executor only
  when the packet has one narrow file/surface cluster, named acceptance lines,
  one explicit proof command, and a hard stop. Across RT-001..RT-004 it produced
  useful decomposition or partial patches, but timed out or under-covered
  closure often enough that it should not self-close authority-sensitive work.
- `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning is useful as a cheap focused validator
  for one failing test, one resolver path, or one source-fidelity check. It is
  not sufficient as the only broad validator for TaskFlow, receipt authority,
  host-bridge, projection-cache, or public operator-surface changes.
- `gpt-5.5-low` is the preferred bounded rework executor after mini timeout,
  shutdown, partial patch, or validator rejection. It is cheaper than medium
  while still strong enough for narrow runtime implementation when the
  orchestrator provides exact files, invariants, proof commands, and non-goals.
- `gpt-5.5-medium` is the preferred authority validator. It caught false-green
  risks, scope limits, adjacent failures, and closure evidence gaps more
  consistently than mini validators. Keep prompts short and risk-specific
  because long broad validation prompts can still time out.
- Root orchestrator remains the consolidator. It may accept cheap-agent work as
  evidence, but closure requires local proof, TaskFlow update, debug build,
  commit, push when currently authorized, and a recorded scorecard.

Current routing recommendation:
- Executor first pass: `gpt-5.4-mini` with highest available reasoning for
  read-only decomposition, source-sync docs, exact regression-test authoring, or
  one small implementation packet with a single proof command.
- Executor rework: `gpt-5.5-low` when mini output is partial, times out, misses
  acceptance, or touches production runtime authority.
- Validator: `gpt-5.5-medium` for authority-sensitive code, public operator
  JSON, TaskFlow state, receipt logic, host bridge, release closure, and PR
  integration.
- Extra cheap validator: `gpt-5.4-mini` with highest reasoning only for a narrow
  second opinion over one named risk.
- Triple validation: use only when validators disagree, the patch changes a
  shared authority predicate, or the task would close a wave/epic/release gate.
- PR/open-source intake: use the same ladder as any source-neutral work item;
  bind an explicit TaskFlow item first, split by non-conflicting PR families, and
  keep GitHub mutation authority in the orchestrator.
- Timeout/shutdown/no-artifact: classify as `process_failure`, close the handle,
  score the attempt low, and either narrow the packet or escalate to
  `gpt-5.5-low`/`gpt-5.5-medium` according to executor or validator role.

Required agent final report:
- `changed_files` or reviewed read-only scope,
- `verification`,
- `gaps`,
- exact proof commands with pass/fail/not-run status,
- residual risks and blockers,
- `tokens_used` or `not_exposed_by_host`,
- `steps_taken`,
- `tool_calls_used`,
- `agent_score_10` assigned by the orchestrator after validation.

## 2026-06-11 - todo-agent-routing-optimization-docs

Scope:
- Task: `todo-agent-routing-optimization-docs`
- Files: `docs/process/team-development-and-orchestration-protocol.md`,
  `docs/process/multi-agent-stage-ensemble-protocol.md`,
  `docs/process/agent-model-evaluation-log.md`, `docs/process/agent-system.md`

Observed model results:
- Analyst `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. The first 120-second
  wait timed out and the orchestrator closed the handle too early, but after
  resume and an explicit compact final-report request the agent returned a
  useful section-level edit plan with `tokens_used`, `steps_taken`, and
  `tool_calls_used`.
- Orchestrator action: classified the attempt as `process_failure`, closed the
  host handle too early, resumed it after operator correction, accepted the
  returned handoff as evidence, activated a docs-only exception takeover, and
  updated the process docs directly.

Next-task selection rule:
- Use mini for read-only analysis when its result can arrive in parallel and the
  critical path can proceed without waiting, or when the orchestrator is willing
  to wait a longer interval and request a compact partial/final report before
  cleanup.
- For blocker-critical analysis, use `gpt-5.5-medium` or split mini prompts into
  smaller single-question probes with shorter expected artifacts.
