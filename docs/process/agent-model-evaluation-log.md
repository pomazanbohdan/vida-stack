# Agent Model Evaluation Log

Purpose: record per-task executor/validator efficiency evidence so the next VIDA
task can choose a cheaper or stronger model deliberately.

## 2026-06-11 - lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority

Scope:
- Task: `lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority`
- Files: `crates/vida/src/lane_surface.rs`, `crates/vida/tests/task_smoke.rs`
- Proof:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo test -p vida --test task_smoke external_attempt_scope_guard -- --exact --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p vida lane_surface::tests::lane_complete_host_bridge_rejects_unverified_request_artifacts -- --exact --nocapture`

Observed model results:
- Executor `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. It produced the
  correct success-path direction and useful regression assertions, but timed out
  without a final report and missed blocked-result blocker preservation.
- Validator `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning: 0/10 for this slice because it
  timed out and returned no actionable validation evidence.
- Orchestrator scoped fix: one narrow local correction under active exception
  takeover restored the blocked-result summary/delegated-cycle blocker.

Next-task selection rule:
- Use `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` only for one-file execution packets with one
  focused proof command and an explicit stop point.
- Do not use long-running `gpt-5.5 medium` validation prompts until the host
  agent timeout/runtime blocker is fixed; prefer shorter read-only prompts split
  by concrete risk.
- Require final reports to include proof commands, pass/fail counts, token usage
  if exposed, and tool-call count or an explicit "not exposed" statement.

## 2026-06-11 - wave0-consume-resume-missing-task-guard-order
- Task: `wave0-consume-resume-missing-task-guard-order`
- File: `crates/vida/src/taskflow_consume_resume.rs`
- Proof:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo test -p vida validate_run_graph_resume_state -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p vida resolve_runtime_consumption_resume_inputs -- --nocapture`
Observed model results:
- Executor `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 0/10 for execution in this
  slice because the worker timed out without a completion receipt or patch
  closure.
- Validator `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning: 8/10. It caught three real
  false-green risks: unsuperseded exception takeover authority, retry-eligible
  missing-task bypass, and candidate downstream packet evidence without result
  lineage. It did not run tests.
- Validator `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. It caught the remaining
  default no-`--run-id` explicit-binding redirect gap and supplied focused test
  evidence, but it missed the broader predicate risks caught by 5.5.
- Orchestrator scoped fix: accepted both validators, narrowed authority
  predicates, kept stale missing-task fail-closed behavior, and passed focused
  proof.
Next-task selection rule:
- Use `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` as a cheap focused validator for one failing
  test or one resolver path, not as the only broad reviewer.
- Use `gpt-5.5 medium` validator for predicate/authority reviews where
  false-green risk matters.
