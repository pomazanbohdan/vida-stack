# Agent Model Evaluation Log

Purpose: record per-task executor/validator efficiency evidence so the next VIDA
task can choose a cheaper or stronger model deliberately.

## 2026-06-11 - lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority

Scope:
- Task: `lane-surface-host-bridge-receipt-authority`
- Files: `crates/vida/src/lane_surface.rs`, `crates/vida/tests/task_smoke.rs`
- Proof:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo test -p vida --test task_smoke external_attempt_scope_guard -- --exact --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p vida lane_surface::tests::lane_complete_host_bridge_rejects_unverified_request_artifacts -- --exact --nocapture`

Observed model results:
- Executor `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` reasoning: 7/10. It produced the
  correct success-path direction and useful regression assertions, but timed out
  without a final report and missed blocked-result blocker preservation.
- Validator `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning: 0/10 for this slice because it
  timed out and returned no actionable validation evidence.
- Orchestrator scoped fix: one narrow local correction under active exception
  takeover restored the blocked-result summary/delegated-cycle blocker.

Next-task selection rule:
- Use `gpt-5.4-mini` with `xhigh` only for one-file execution packets with one
  focused proof command and an explicit stop point.
- Do not use long-running `gpt-5.5 medium` validation prompts until the host
  agent timeout/runtime blocker is fixed; prefer shorter read-only prompts or
  local proof-first validation.
- Require final reports to include proof commands, pass/fail counts, token usage
  if exposed, and tool-call count or an explicit "not exposed" statement.
